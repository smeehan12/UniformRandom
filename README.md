# Random Numbers

This is an example program to give you a hint about how to generate uniformly distributed random numbers.

# Execution
Execute the following to compile and run
```
g++ random.cxx
./a.out
```

# Condition
Evenly (i.e. uniformly) distributed random numbers have the condition that for an ensemble
of numbers that together fulfill this condition, if you choose the i-th number of the j-th
number from this ensemble, there is the same probability density to be anywhere between
[0,1).
